#### **`B2B Value Proposition Raizen`**

##### Dashboards for different departments - May 24

By accessing the database, I designed tailored dashboards in accordance with the requirements outlined by the commercial teams. These dashboards were meticulously crafted to filter information and facilitate specific analyses, empowering both the commercial teams and myself to conduct more thorough, effective assessments of market data. Additionally, I contributed to the development of a dedicated retail dashboard for another team within the organization, further expanding the reach and impact of analytical capabilities.

I also led the development of a specialized dashboard tailored for tracking a promotional campaign, meticulously filtering data to suit this specific scenario. In this initiative, our goal was to boost both volume and premium sales while expanding our reach to indirect clients through distributors. We devised a comprehensive program, outlining objectives for distributor managers, sales teams, and clients alike. This dashboard proved instrumental in monitoring progress and demand for results throughout the campaign. Despite the ambitious nature of our objectives, while it may seem that we did not fully meet them, the results speak: volumes Sales experienced a notable 13% growth compared to the previous year, accompanied by a 4% increase in our customer base.

#### **`Pro bono experience`**

##### Scoring system - Apr 24

Designed to revolutionize the assessment of drivers seeking financial support from a company specializing in lending infrastructure for banks and fintechs. By seamlessly integrating with drivers' apps such as Uber and Cabify, the notebook harnesses their earnings history, trip data, and engagement with the lending company to generate a comprehensive scoring system. This innovative solution empowers the company to make informed credit offers to mobility gig workers, leveraging their driving history as a reliable indicator of creditworthiness, ultimately expanding access to financial services for those traditionally excluded from the system.

#### **`Data Science in Soy Henry`**

##### Final Project - Integrative Project - Oct 23

Designed a data pipeline that seamlessly ingests raw data through Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This pipeline performs ETL functions to load the data into BigQuery. Subsequently, by integrating with Power BI and Streamlit, it powers an efficient web platform. This platform not only provides restaurant recommendation systems but also offers a dynamic dashboard for tracking essential KPIs

#### **`Data Science in Coderhouse`**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan-Portfolio/blob/master/Files/Project_ds_coder.ipynb)

#### **`Data Analytics in Rocking data`**

I  developed a dashboard specifically for my work at Raizen to analyze the company's information about what we sell to our distributors and what our distributors sell to salespoints.

This all started when my company's BI area report was malfunctioning due to unproperly integration of data. I developed this dashboard to solve that problem. I got the sell in information from our company's internal data repository, and for sell out, I used an external repository host for information where it was performed some ETL of data so we could match distributors information to talk the same language as us(for example: transformation of distributors SKUs codes to my companies name and information associated to them).

[File.pbix](https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan-Portfolio/blob/master/Files/Distribudores_adaptado.pbix)-[PDF](https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan-Portfolio/blob/master/Files/Distribudores_adaptado.pdf)

#### **`Data Science in Digital House`**
The objective of this notebook is to see the movement of the Argentinian's government bikes "Ecobicis". We created a model to predict the flow of bikes, this way we could isolate which bike stations have bigger demand and redistribute supply accordingly.

[Notebook](https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan-Portfolio/blob/master/Files/Ecobici.ipynb)

#### **`Business Intelligence Analyst - Pernod Ricard`**

As a BI Analyst I was in charge of teaching our sales and marketing departments to use our developed Power BI dashboards to help them make informed decisions.

[PDF](https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan-Portfolio/blob/master/Files/Induccion_Power_BI.pdf)

This dashboard was developed for the BI-EXPORT team, before they didn't had any dashboards, so all their analyses were made in Excel. This dashboard was developed for them so they could manage better their information.

[PDF](https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan-Portfolio/blob/master/Files/BI_Export_AR.pdf)

This dashboard  was presented as an idea, to show to my bosses, how to analyze our distributors sell out information(their sells to their customers) before there was nothing. This then turned into a big project of analysing all of our distributors information, all in one dashboard, where we performed ETL to adapt our distributors information to our companies same language. (I don't have this final dashboard due to not working more in the company and confidentiality information) but i will post the idea presented at the beginning.
